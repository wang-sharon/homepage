# About Me
I am a  researcher interested in interpersonal and gender-based violence. Drawing concepts from intersectional feminism and social justice, I aim to examine the ways that individual and contextual factors intersectionally influence the experience and outcomes of sexual violence and intimate partner violence.

I am currently a research specialist in the [Social and Behavioral Development Lab](https://lilab.waisman.wisc.edu/) at the Waisman Center \(University of Wisconsin-Madison\), working with [Dr. James Li](https://lilab.waisman.wisc.edu/staff/li-james/).

In my spare time, I like to travel, hike, paint, and annoy my [cat](https://www.instagram.com/juno_thefloof/).
