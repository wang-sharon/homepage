# About Me
I am a researcher with a passion for exploring the complex dynamics of gender-based violence. Drawing concepts from intersectional feminism and social justice, my work centers around examining the interplay of individual and contextual factors that contribute to the experience and outcomes of gender-based violence, particularly in underrepresented populations. I employ a diverse range of research methods, including data science, quantitative and qualitative psychology, and statistics. Through my work, I hope to contribute to a greater understanding of the nuanced and multifaceted factors that perpetuate gender-based violence. Ultimately, my goal is to create personalized, innovative solutions for survivors of gender-based violence.

Currently, I am a clinical psychology PhD student at the University of Washington, advised by [Dr. William H. George](https://psych.uw.edu/directory/2743) and [Dr. Mary Larimer](https://psych.uw.edu/directory/2697). I am also mentored by [Dr. Jessica Blayney](https://jessicablayney.com/) and [Dr. Anna Jaffe](https://psychiatry.uw.edu/profile/anna-jaffe/). In my spare time, I like to travel, hike, ice skate, knit, and annoy my [cat](https://www.instagram.com/juno_thefloof/).
