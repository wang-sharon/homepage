# About Me
I am a researcher interested in interpersonal and gender-based violence. Drawing concepts from intersectional feminism and social justice, I aim to examine the ways that individual and contextual factors intersectionally influence the experience and outcomes of sexual violence and intimate partner violence, especially in underrepresented populations.

Currently, I am a clinical psychology PhD student at the University of Washington, advised by [Dr. William H. George](https://psych.uw.edu/directory/2743) and [Dr. Mary Larimer](https://psych.uw.edu/directory/2697). Previously, I was a lab manager in the [Social and Behavioral Development Lab](https://lilab.waisman.wisc.edu/) at the Waisman Center \(University of Wisconsin-Madison\), working with Dr. James Li.

In my spare time, I like to travel, hike, paint, and annoy my [cat](https://www.instagram.com/juno_thefloof/).

## Research
*Current Projects*
 * Sexual Assault and Identity Disruption (SAID) *\*coming soon\**
 * [Resilience as a Moderator (ResMod)](https://osf.io/bj5ck): (1) Examine the association between number of sexual violence victimization experiences and post-traumatic stress symptoms; (2) Explore whether resilience factors (e.g., emotion regulation, mindfulness, coping strategies) moderate this association 

*Past Projects*
 * [Maltreatment & Depression (MaltDep)](https://osf.io/zn3t6): (1) Compared latent growth trajectories of depression in individuals with and without maltreatment histories; (2) Examined how individuals with maltreatment histories fare relative to their counterparts without maltreatment histories on adult-measured outcomes
